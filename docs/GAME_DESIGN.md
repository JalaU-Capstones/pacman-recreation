# Game Design Document

## Overview
This Pac-Man recreation follows the original 1980 arcade game mechanics with modern improvements.

## Level Design

### Level Progression
Three levels with increasing difficulty ensure both accessibility for new players and challenge for experienced ones.

**Difficulty Curve:**
- Level 1: Learning phase - Players learn ghost behaviors and power pellet usage
- Level 2: Challenge phase - Faster ghosts require better planning
- Level 3: Mastery phase - Maximum difficulty tests all skills learned

### Why 3 Levels?
- Academic project scope (4-week timeline)
- Sufficient challenge progression
- Complete gameplay loop (beginning -> middle -> end)
- Allows for victory celebration without endless repetition

## Ghost AI Philosophy

Each ghost has a unique personality based on the original game:
- **Blinky**: Direct and relentless
- **Pinky**: Strategic ambusher
- **Inky**: Unpredictable flanker
- **Clyde**: Chaotic and shy

This diversity ensures varied gameplay and strategic depth.

## Power Pellet Balancing

Power pellet duration decreases with levels to:
- Increase difficulty without frustrating players
- Encourage more skillful ghost avoidance
- Maintain risk/reward balance
- Prevent Level 3 from becoming too easy

## Victory Screen

The victory screen serves multiple purposes:
- Provides closure and accomplishment
- Displays final score for bragging rights
- Offers immediate replay option
- Celebrates player achievement
